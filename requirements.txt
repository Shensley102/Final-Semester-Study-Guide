# Depend on the latest available versions of Flask and its core dependencies.
# Pinning to specific patch versions caused installation failures on Vercel
# because those exact releases weren't available on PyPI. Allowing pip to
# resolve to the most recent compatible versions helps ensure the build
# succeeds without losing functionality.  See PR discussion for details.
